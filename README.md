## Summary

NYC Public Parks Bathroom Guide uses the NYC Parks API to aggregate summary information about the bathrooms operated by the New York Parks Deparment. Upon submitting text into the search bar, the app will check for a match to the search term in the name, location, or comment for each registered bathroom. These reults can be further filtered by selecting one of the borough radio-buttons below the search bar. Users can then navigate through these results and view the name, location, borough, and associated comments (if there are any associated with that particular location). Additionally, pressing the *Show Me* button will attempt to map the location in a new window with Google Maps.
