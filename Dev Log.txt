(1) Added API functionality, AJAX() settings, and a template for displaying API data.
(2) Also added a Bootstrap script --> should look into collapsible functionality/check-in with Mark

---To Do---
(1) Check in with Mark about Bootstrap OR shorten the display list and add navigation buttons
--> alternatively, look into displaying the info within the google map
(2) Add a Google Map and markers --> will require geocoding for the Approved Events data
(3) Add a search function for the Approved Events page
(4) Find a way to clean up the start_date and end_date values
--> switch the date format
--> clip seconds and milliseconds off of the display value
--> event_name on top and start_date on the bottom
